The staff was not very knowledgeable and seemed more interested in closing the sale quickly rather than ensuring I was satisfied with my purchase. There were also some issues with the billing process, which took longer than necessary to resolve. Despite these challenges, I appreciate the product quality and would consider returning, but only if the service improves.",
